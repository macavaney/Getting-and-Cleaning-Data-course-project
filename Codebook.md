# Codebook: description of variables

Detailed descriptions of the naming of the initial variables (the smartphone measurements) as well as the methods with which they were gathered can be found in the features_info.txt and README.txt files within the dataset that was downloaded.
To summarize: they come from the accelerometer and gyroscope raw time domain signals, and they were collected for 3 directions (X, Y and Z).

Within the tidy dataset in this assignment, the following variables are included:
* Subject (1-30) who performed the activities
* Activity performed while wearing the smartphone (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
* The mean of certain variables, by subject and activity (the variables for which the mean is calculated are the mean and standard deviation of each measurement taken)
