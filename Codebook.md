# Codebook: description of variables

Descriptions of the initial variables (the smartphone measurements) can be found in the features_info.txt and README.txt files within the dataset that was downloaded.

Within the tidy dataset in this assignment, the following variables are included:
* Subject (1-30) who performed the activities
* Activity performed while wearing the smartphone (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
* The mean of certain variables, by subject and activity (the variables for which the mean is calculated are the mean and standard deviation of each measurement taken)
